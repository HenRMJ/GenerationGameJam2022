  - 'Flame: Wow, you must be the new soul collector!'
  - 'You: I suppose I am. Why are you here in this cave?'
  - 'Flame: It''s just a nice place to rest I suppose. HIdden away. I like to be
    with my thoughts sometimes.'
  - 'You: I see. Do all flames look the same?'
  - 'Flame: Yeah for the most part. I haven''t encountered any that don''t look like
    me but you never know. '
  - 'You: Do you have a name?'
  - 'Flame: Of course! I don''t usually give it out though. You live in the afterlife
    for 10,000 years and names sort of start to become irrelevant. Most flames forget
    after a while as well.'
  - 'You: So what''s your name?'
  repeatingText: 'Flame: Hahaha! I''ll tell you what if you collect (current to win)
    souls. I''ll tell you my name.'
  successText: 'Linda Bryan: My name is Linda. Linda Bryan. Those words feel weird
    coming out of my mouth. But there you go. I know most flames don''t bother remembering
    their names. But I don''t know... it helps me remember my past I suppose.'
