  - 'Flame: Hello.'
  - 'You: Hello... where are we?'
  - 'Flame: This is the afterlife.'
  - 'You: The afterlife? So I''m... I''m dead?'
  - 'Flame: Yeah but it''s not as bad as it could''ve been. At least your mind and
    soul are still connected.'
  - 'You: What do you mean? It seems like your mind and soul are connected too. It
    doesn''t seem to be that special.'
  - 'Flame: You''re right. I would say, I might even be luckier than you. I''ve even
    kept all my memories from my life. Try to remember who you are.'
  - 'You: That''s easy I''m... I uh... I know I was alive.'
  - 'Flame: Well your definitely right about that. No one knows how its decided but
    some people die and become flames like myself. As a flame, I''ve kept all my
    memories and personality.'
  - 'You: What am I?'
  - 'Flame: From the looks of it, you seem to be a soul collector. You''ve kept your
    mind and soul but no memories. Most people don''t even get that.'
  - 'You: What do most people get?'
  - 'Flame: Most are separated from their soul and spend an eternity suffering in
    silence. I''ve never experienced it but I''ve heard stories of it being the worst
    thing ever.'
  - 'You: That''s horrible! There''s nothing we can do to help them?'
  - 'Flame: Haha whenever I meet a new soul collector they always ask that question.
    I guess thats why you were chosen to be one. I can''t do anything about it. But
    I see you already freed (collected number).'
  - 'You: Is that what those things were? I just saw one and picked it up but it
    disappeared.'
  - 'Flame: Yeah those are lost souls. They are everywhere. In this dimension there
    were (total number) souls.'
  - 'You: This dimension?'
  - 'Flame: Yes you need to collect a certain number of souls to move on to the next
    dimension. There''s a portal in every dimension that takes you to the next one.'
  - 'You: So how many more souls do I need to travel to the next dimension.'
  repeatingText: 'Flame: You need (current to win) souls to move on to the next dimension.
    There are still (current number) more souls in this dimension. You should try
    to save them all.'
  successText: 'Flame: You did it! The portal to the next dimension should be open
    now. It''s all the way on the top right cliff. There are (current number) souls
    left in this dimension.'
