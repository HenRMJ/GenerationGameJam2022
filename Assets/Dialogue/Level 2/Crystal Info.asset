  - 'Flame: Wow you have a blue crystal!'
  - 'You: Nice!... what does it do?'
  - 'Flame: You have to select the crystal you want to use before using it! Crystals
    are items that only soul collectors can use. The blue crystal pushes you away
    from it.'
  - 'You: That doesn''t sound too useful.'
  - 'Flame: Well, I''ve seen other soul collectors time the their jump over the crystal
    giving them a sort of boost to their jump. The crystal activates after 1 second.'
  - 'You: Oh wow! Okay so... why would I need a super jump?'
  repeatingText: 'Flame: Certain dimensions have areas that are only acccesable using
    the crystal so use it wisely.'
