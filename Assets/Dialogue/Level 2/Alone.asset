  - 'Flame: Wow, nobody has ever found me down here.'
  - 'You: Oh sorry did you not want to be found?'
  - 'Flame: No, it''s just suprising. But I mean... you''re a soul collector so you
    are a lot more mobile than us flames. '
  - 'You: I saw the crystal and I couldn''t help myself. Sorry to bother you.'
  - 'Flame: It''s ok, I know being a soul collector is busy work. Jumping from dimension
    to dimension. Speaking of how many souls have you collected in this dimension.'
  - 'You: So far I have (collected number) souls.'
  - 'Flame: Nice, I know there''s more down the tunnel. I always see them but there''s
    nothing I can do about them.'
  - 'You: Thanks for the heads up.'
  - 'Flame: Oh and if you happen to free more souls. I can tell you more about the
    crystals.'
  repeatingText: 'You: Oh wow! Sure that would helpful! I''ll come back when I''ve
    collected more.'
  successText: 'Flame: Crystals are built in pairs. For every crystal there is an
    opposite. Sort of like Ying and Yang. Crystals have different properties also.
    No two crystals act the same. '
