  - 'Flame: Do you wonder why we''re here?'
  - 'You: Well, I''m here to free souls.'
  - 'Flame: Sure... but why? Who put us here. During my time with the living, there
    were so many differing ideas about what happens when we arrive here. And now
    we''re here and I still feel like there''s so much I don''t know.'
  - 'You: How long have you been here?'
  - 'Flame: I''ve been here a relatively short amount of time. Only 200 years but
    I feel like that''s long enough to figure more out. Why do we still not know
    anything.'
  - 'You: Maybe it''s because I''m new but I find a lot of solace in doing what I
    do.'
  - 'Flame: Maybe it''s because I''ve been here a while but... I don''t know. I didn''t
    think I would have to have faith in the afterlife too.'
  repeatingText: 'You: I hope you find the answers you''re looking for.'
