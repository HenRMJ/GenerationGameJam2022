  - 'Flame: What do you want?'
  - 'You: Whoa. That''s a little hostile. I''ve met plenty of flames already. They
    were all pretty nice. What''s up with you?'
  - 'Flame: I just found out I died... how am I supposed to act?'
  - 'You: Oh... I''m sorry... are you new here too?'
  - 'Flame: I don''t know. I guess. I talked to a few other people and they said
    that they''ve been here a lot longer.'
  - 'You: What''s your name?'
  - 'Carlos: It''s Carlos... I hate that everyone here doesn''t have names. I don''t
    want to become like them. What''s your name?'
  - 'You: Well uh... I don''t know...'
  - 'Carlos: Oh of course another one. You''ve been here so long you can''t even
    remember your name.'
  - 'You: I''m new here too. I''m just a soul collector. Soul collectors don''t get
    to keep their memories after death.'
  - 'Carlos: What? Aren''t you curious about who you were? Are you even sure that
    you were alive?'
  - 'You: I am a little curious but I know I was alive. I don''t know how to explain
    it but... I just know I had a past with the living. '
  - 'Carlos: How are you not in distress right now? How can you just BE without knowing
    who you were?'
  - 'You: I don''t know who I was before but... now I feel like I have purpose here.
    Every soul that I free feels like I''m finally offering relief to someone who
    has been suffering for a long time.'
  - 'Carlos: It''s different for me. I remember my son. I''ll never be able to see
    him grow. I had a wife that I loved. I''ll never be able to hold her again.'
  - 'You: I''m sorry... I don''t know what you''re going through. I can''t know but...
    I hope you find some purpose here in the afterlife.'
